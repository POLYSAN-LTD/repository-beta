## What’s changed

This release adds support for Blueprints! 🎉 

Additionally, ESPHome files are now handled and assigned correctly. This would give you an amazing auto-completion and validation experience on your ESPHome configuration files.

ℹ️  Note: It might be that you run a custom configuration/settings for VSCode, in that case, the ESPHome change will not be applied automatically. Be sure to reset your setting in that case. For more information refer to the documentation:
