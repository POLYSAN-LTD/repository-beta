[Full Changelog][changelog]

This release downgrades ZeroTier One from 1.6.0 to 1.4.6.

The latest releases cause a lot of problems on many occasions and extensive testing and tuning haven't lead to a working stable solution. At this point, the only solution is the downgrade in this release.

If you are using add-on version v0.8.0, without issues, you can, of course, skip this release.

Hopefully, the ZeroTier team is able to address the many issues the community has raised with the 1.6.0 version.
