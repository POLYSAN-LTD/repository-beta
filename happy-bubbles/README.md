Presence detection server for Happy Bubbles Bluetooth beacon-based
presence detection system.

## Deprecation warning

**This add-on is in a deprecated state!**

The Happy Bubbles project/company announced in 2018, that they would take a
break. Two years later, they still haven't returned and at this point,
it seems unlikely that that will every happen.

See: <https://www.happybubbles.tech/blog/post/2018-hiatus/>

The time has come to deprecate this add-on because of the above. If you
are still in need of running a Happy Bubbles presence server, please refer to
the official Happy Bubbles site.

## About

This add-on is a server that subscribes to MQTT topics that the "Happy Bubbles"
Bluetooth Beacon Presence Detectors publish to. It checks to see which of the
detectors found the strongest signal for a particular beacon, and then lets
you access that info either over an API, or a web interface.

It is designed to be used as a home-automation presence detection system.
If you install the detectors through-out a home and family members carry
beacons around the house, you can program your home automation hubs to
take certain actions depending on who entered or left certain rooms.

This add-on also publishes changes in location to a particular topic.
So you can program your hub to listen for these and make the desired changes
as they happen, to not have to keep polling it.
