## What’s changed

**EVERYTHING**!

Even its name has been changed from "JupyterLab Lite" to just "JupyterLab".

So, it has been a while since this add-on had an update. This was mainly caused by a heavy build process and an almost impossible set to build for all architectures. Therefore, this release brings almost a completely new add-on!

So for the biggest changes since the last release:

- The add-on now runs on Debian as its base.
- Support for `armhf`/`armv7` has been dropped.
- Direct access to the JupyterLabs ports has been dropped.
- **Home Assistant Ingress** support has been added! 
- All dependencies are updated to the latest possible versions.
- The add-on is now built on GitHub Actions.
- The add-on is distributed via the GitHub Container Registry.

The add-on is now a single-click install, start and go experience 🤘 
And with all current changes, I can actually maintain it now 😁 

Enjoy the release!
