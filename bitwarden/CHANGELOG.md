## What’s changed

This add-on is based on Bitwarden RS, which has now renamed: Vaultwarden.
They changed their name mainly to make it clear their backend is their own,
not to be confused with Bitwarden.

This release has some visual changes to naming and documentation to
reflect that upstream naming change.
