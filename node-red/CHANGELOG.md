## What’s changed

Major release time!
A lot of dependencies updated, but the kicker here is the upgrade of the Alpine Linux operating system this add-on runs on.

Additionally, the add-on is now built & shipped via GitHub using their GitHub Actions and the GitHub Container Registry.
This means; we no longer depend on DockerHub and their new API limits.
