## What’s changed

The previous release was withdrawn, because it implemented, opt-out, telemetry by the upstream Z-WaveJS2MQTT project. 
This release corrects that! The telemetry is now opt-in, as it should be!

When you open the Z-WaveJS2MQTT interface now, it will ask you if you want to join in on helping to improve the upstream project by sharing your data. It is up to you if you choose to do so or not.
