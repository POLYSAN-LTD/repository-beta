## What’s changed

This is a major release. This add-on now runs on the latest Alpine Linux, meaning almost all dependencies have been updated.
Furthermore, this add-on is now built on GitHub Actions and distributed via the GitHub Container Registry (you should not notice, but still a big change).

Everything is shiny new and fresh!
